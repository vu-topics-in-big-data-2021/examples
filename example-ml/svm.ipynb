One way that we often do this in data science is to create a train-test split of the data. This process involves dividing (usually randomly) the full dataset into two mutually exclusive sets: one set that will be used to train the model and one set that will be used to test the model. This provides an accurate picture of how the model performs on data that it has never seen before.\n",

In this case, we will also set what is called a random seed to ensure that everyone in the class gets the same train-test split."
